Welcome!


# Exploring the data

Download from the TidyTuesday Github:
https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-08-17/readme.md

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

computer <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-08-17/computer.csv')
```

```{r}
head(computer)
```

Questions:
- name - what does that mean? Why is it a number?
  
- Duplicates in line
  
- Line vs interaction?
  
- type vs pri_type
  
- domain vs subdomain
  
- nv_resp, is_fed, error
  

```{r}
computer %>% 
  count(char_type)
```
