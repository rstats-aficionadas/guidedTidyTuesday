Data source: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/2e9bd5a67e09b14d01f616b00f7f7e0931515d24/data/2020/2020-07-07/readme.md

Let's read in the data and get a first impression! The Tidy Tuesday site includes a link to read in the data and information on the variables. 

# Importing data and package(s)
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

coffee <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-07-07/coffee_ratings.csv')
```

Which options do we have to explore the data?

```{r}
head(coffee)

summary(coffee)

str(coffee)
```
